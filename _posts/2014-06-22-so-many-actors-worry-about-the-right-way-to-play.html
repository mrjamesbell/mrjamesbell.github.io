<br/><p>So many actors worry about the &lsquo;right&rsquo; way to play a character or a scene.</p>
<p>They rush to a movie version or something they&rsquo;ve seen on YouTube and copy it. But then you aren&rsquo;t acting, you are doing the acting equivalent of karaoke.</p>
<p>Next time you are worried, be like Dave Grohl. Do it your way.</p>
